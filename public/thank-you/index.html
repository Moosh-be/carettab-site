        <h2>Hey there, thanks for using CaretTab!</h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, a huge shout-out to you for being part of the CaretTab
          family. It's not easy to say goodbye, but remember, every ending is
          just a new beginning in disguise.
        </p>
        <h3>Did you hit a roadblock?</h3>

          interesting ideas on how to make CaretTab better, I'm all ears. Your
          insights are what help keep CaretTab evolving.

        <p>
          For those who've signed up for Premium Access, please note that you
          can only unsubscribe from within the extension itself. If you're

          return and try out the new and improved CaretTab anytime. Updates and
          enhancements are always in the works, and it might just turn out that

        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I want to express my gratitude once again for giving CaretTab
